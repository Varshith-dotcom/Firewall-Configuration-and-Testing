# Firewall-Configuration-and-Testing
This project focuses on configuring and testing firewall rules to control network traffic and enhance system security. The objective is to understand how firewalls manage inbound and outbound connections by allowing trusted services and blocking insecure or unauthorized access. Firewall rules were created to restrict vulnerable ports.
